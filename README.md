# EasyTravel 

### Abstract
Final solo project Module 3. I was tasked with building an application in 6 days that would display dynamic use of React, React Hooks, React Router, React Testing Library + Jest. Easy Travel is an application that allows a user to search through international Holidays to ease travel planning. A user can select if the holiday is one they would like to Attend or one to Avoid depending if the user is trying to avoid crowds or would like to experience cultural immersion. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project was tested with React Testing Library + Jest.

### Installation instructions:
In the project directory, you can run:
### `clone repository in your terminal`
### `npm install`
### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.










### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).
